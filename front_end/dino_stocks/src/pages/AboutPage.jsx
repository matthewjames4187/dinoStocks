            <h2>Dino-Stocks Terminology</h2>
            <section>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Tyranno-trading Dino-Arb: Imagine two dinosaur friends, T-Rex and Stegosaurus. T-Rex realizes that Stegosaurus is trading his leaves for shiny rocks with another dinosaur, Triceratops. T-Rex notices that Stegosaurus can get more leaves by trading with another dinosaur, Ankylosaurus. So, T-Rex helps Stegosaurus make a clever trade and get more leaves.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ask-Rex: Ask-Rex is like when Triceratops has a cool leaf and other dinosaurs want it. They ask Triceratops, "What do you want in return for your awesome leaf?"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dino-Diversity Allocation: Dinosaurs, like Velociraptor and Brachiosaurus, have different strengths. Brachiosaurus is strong, and Velociraptor is fast. Dino-Diversity Allocation means making sure you have both strong and fast dinosaurs in your dino-pack to be ready for any adventure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dino-Asset Classes: Just as there are different types of dinosaurs, like flying Pterodactyls and ground-walking Triceratops, there are different Dino-Asset Classes. Some dinosaurs like leaves, and others like shiny rocks!
                        Averaging Down-Dino: If your Ankylosaurus friend trades his ferns for a toy and later finds a better toy, he can use more ferns to get the new toy. This makes the average cost lower, and Ankylosaurus is happy with his clever trading.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Grumpy-Dino Market: Imagine all the dinosaurs like Stegosaurus and Triceratops looking sad because the value of their favorite toys (like leaves and shiny rocks) is going down. That's a Grumpy-Dino Market!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Beta-Dino: Beta-Dino is like measuring how bouncy a bouncy-ball dinosaur is compared to the entire dino-herd. Some dinosaurs bounce a lot (high beta), and others not so much (low beta).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Begging Dino-Bid: The Begging Dino-Bid is when a dinosaur really wants a cool toy from another dino-friend. The dino says, "I'll trade you some berries and tree bark for your awesome toy!"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bite-Me Dino-Ask Spread: The Bite-Me Dino-Ask Spread is the difference between what one dino is willing to give (Bite) and what another dino wants in return (Ask) for a toy. It's like saying, "I'll bite off a leaf and ask for your toy in return!"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rock-Chain: The Rock-Chain is a special dino-language that helps all the dinosaurs remember who owns which toy. It's like having a leafy message that travels to every dino in the herd.
                    </li>
